## Learning Cooking

Hey, I have to learn how to cook, write me a plan step by step as a todo list here, make each learning
step learnable in one day, and space them out 4 days apart starting from the upcoming weekend (friday).

---

I actually did all the steps up to and including [tomato], mark all of those as complete, and move the incomplete
tasks to start from tomorrow again.

---

shit, I thought I actually thought I learned to [done task], but actually I didn't because I actually did [a different variant of the task];
create the new variation as a task and mark it as complete, and re-add the original task to todo.

---

I already did [undone task] today; update plx
